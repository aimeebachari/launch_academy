# My Launch Academy Work Repo

This repo can contain all the work you do while you study at Launch Academy. The commit history can nicely illustrate your day to day progress. Below, you will find instructions on how to use this repo when it comes to day-to-day workflow. 

1. Create a branch for your lesson or challenge. Use the name of the assignment/challenge as your branch name.
2. `et get` your assignment.
3. Do your work. Add the changes and commit them.
4. If you have to stop working mid-assignment and do another assignment, then add and commit your work in progress. Checkout master. Then create a new branch for whatever you'd like to start, per step 1.
5. When you finish working, commit your changes and push up your branch. Create a pull request.
6. Ping someone to review your work, like Omid.
7. When the cycle of review is complete, merge your branch.
8. Checkout master on your machine and `git pull origin master` to get your new additions. 

This document should be a reference tool. You can and should commit changes to it to make it more valuable.
